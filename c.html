          <h2>ABOUT MY FAMILY</h2>
          <p>Everyone has a family and I have also.<br> I love my family very much. I live with my family.<br> Today I will share something about my family. There are four people in total in our family. My parents, my sister, and me.<br> We are a very small family.

            My father is a doctor and my mother is a florist, but after their work, they spend so much time with us.<br> They both love us a lot. They work really hard to make our future better. It is a very happy family.<br> If we face any bad time, my parents handle it with care.</p>
